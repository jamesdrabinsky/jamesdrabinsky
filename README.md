## ðŸš€ Helios

Most recently, I developed [Helios](https://helios-platform.github.io/), an open-source platform designed to simplify the visualization and analysis of real-time event streams by exposing data for SQL querying. Its web app and automated deployment solution is catered to helping Amazon Kinesis users.
